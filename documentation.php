							<h2>How to use the site:</h2>
							<h3>Home Page</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>The home page is mobile-responsive and allows the user to navigate throughout the website.</li>
								<li>You can use the top navigation bar in order to navigate the site.</li>
								<li>Alternatively, the home page also has a reserve button that links to a form to make a reservation.</li>
								<li>The hero landing page area features a looping video with muted sound and an image beneath to showcase the ambience of our cafe.
								<li><i>Note</i>: The logo has an animation that uses both CSS Transition (logo grows bigger) and @keyframes (logo wiggles), and it is also part of our 3 pages mark. The webpage uses flex throughout the whole website while the hamburger menu requires a simple JavaScript function in order to work properly.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Menu</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>The menu showcases all of the delicious delicacies that is available at the cafe.</li>
								<li>The items are seperated as a dl style list which allows for a more descriptive style of list.</li>
								<li><i>Note</i>: This page is part of our 3 pages mark.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Contact Us</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>This part of the website displays a static map of an area in Switzerland where our cafe is "located".</li>
								<li>It also offers a little information about the cafe.</li>
								<li>Lastly, we have a mini profile for Kya and Linda as a fun aside.</li>
								<li><i>Note</i>: This page is part of our 3 pages mark.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Reserve (Form)</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>The user can make a reservation on this page.
								<li>The user will be promoted to supply their full name and email (which are validated) and the day of the week, time, and amount of guests for their visit.
								<li>This cafe only allows for users to book a week in advance because the location makes it difficult to have constant supply of resources to keep it operational beyond the timeframe of a week.
								<li><i>Note</i>: This fulfills the criteria for a form that offers validation. A user can enter their full name and email. The full name is validated by allowing only characters from a to z or A to Z while allowing for spaces. The email field also has form validation by requiring a valid email. Security measures have also been added to prevent SQL injection. A successful reservation will prompt a success message with the confirmation details, and the user can see all current reservations at the bottom of the page.This page is also part of our 3 pages mark.</li>
